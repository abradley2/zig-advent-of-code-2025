# Zig Advent of Code 2025

Requires a [Zig version](https://ziglang.org/download/) >= 0.15.2 which is the latest stable release as of December 2025

Before building, run `make` to setup files

Optionally, delete the `.fingerprint` field from `build.zig.zon`, then run `zig build` to generate a new one

To run a day, run commands from `zig build day_01` to `zig build day_12` 

For tests, run commands from  `zig build day_01_test` to `zig build day_12_test`
